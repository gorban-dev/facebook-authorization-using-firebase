# facebook-authorization-using-firebase
This is a working approach to authorizing in your application using Firebase via Facebook


You need to replace YOUR_APP_ID with your application ID which you can get from Facebook. 

//<string name="facebook_app_id">YOUR_APP_ID</string>
//<string name="fb_login_protocol_scheme">fbYOUR_APP_ID</string>
